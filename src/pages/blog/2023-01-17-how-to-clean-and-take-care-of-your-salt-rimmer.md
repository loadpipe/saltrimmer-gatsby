Cleaning your salt rimmer tool is an important step to maintain its longevity and to ensure that it works properly. Here's one way to clean it:

Rinse the salt rimmer tool with water to remove any excess salt or debris.

Mix a solution of warm water and mild dish soap.

Use a brush or sponge to scrub the tool, paying attention to the salt reservoir and the sponge or brush.

Rinse the tool thoroughly with warm water to remove all soap residue.

Dry the tool thoroughly with a clean towel or let it air dry.

You can also sanitize the tool by using a solution of 1 part vinegar to 3 parts water and then rinsing it with water.

Note that, the cleaning process may vary depending on the type of material of the tool. Always check the manufacturer's instructions before cleaning the tool. Also, it is recommended to clean the tool after each use to prevent build-up of salt, debris or bacteria.
